### Starter kit

Personal project aiming to be a simple starting point for creating React applications in different scenarios.  
there is the excellent create-react-app but sometimes you want to use something of or own, lighter that you understand
and control better, or you simply cannot use CRA in a technical test, and you need a neat and quick start.
By starting a project from this blueprint you should just be able to have all those tools setting properly and working
together correctly.
this is the base of technology configure together:
- React
- Webpack
- Babel
- Jest
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- Prettier
- Husky
- sass

in the future the goal is to create variation of this base for different scenarios such as
- Redux
- React router
- with an express server
- graphql
- with cypress
